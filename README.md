## What is it?
IceBall is a Spigot Minecraft plugin that allows you to have snowball fights with other players in ways you never
expected!

Fight as wizards, clowns, and more as you chunk endless amounts of snowballs at your friends! The more successive hits
you get, the more hit streak awards you are able to earn, such as the legendary air strike and hunger attack!

## How do I use it?
If you are looking to learn how to use or configure IceBall, please visit our wiki (coming soon)!

## Who created it?
This project was started as part of the CrystalCraftMC Development Team, but most credit belongs to Jwood9198 (or
woodrow73 on GitHub), as he designed most of the actual game code and particle effects. Jacc734 also lent him a
great amount of support in this plugin as well! jflory7 only tidied up small things.
